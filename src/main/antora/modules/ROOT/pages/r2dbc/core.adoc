= R2DBC Core Support
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

R2DBC contains a wide range of features:

* Spring configuration support with Java-based `@Configuration` classes for an R2DBC driver instance.
* `R2dbcEntityTemplate` as central class for entity-bound operations that increases productivity when performing common R2DBC operations with integrated object mapping between rows and POJOs.
* Feature-rich object mapping integrated with Spring's Conversion Service.
* Annotation-based mapping metadata that is extensible to support other metadata formats.
* Automatic implementation of Repository interfaces, including support for custom query methods.

For most tasks, you should use `R2dbcEntityTemplate` or the repository support, which both use the rich mapping functionality.
`R2dbcEntityTemplate` is the place to look for accessing functionality such as ad-hoc CRUD operations.
