Spring Data JDBC does little to no logging on its own.
Instead, the mechanics of `JdbcTemplate` to issue SQL statements provide logging.
Thus, if you want to inspect what SQL statements are run, activate logging for Spring's {spring-framework-docs}/data-access.html#jdbc-JdbcTemplate[`NamedParameterJdbcTemplate`] or https://www.mybatis.org/mybatis-3/logging.html[MyBatis].
